# Analysis in PBMC Data: A Comprehensive Study

## Introduction
This repository contains the research and analysis conducted by Jesus Garcia Garcia for HINF 5650, focusing on the joint analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). The study utilizes peak calling, transformation, PCA analysis, and other advanced techniques to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms.

## Study Design
The project involved several steps:
- Peak calling using macs2
- Transformation and PCA analysis on scRNA-seq data
- Analysis of scATAC-seq data including peak detection and term-frequency inverse-document-frequency computation
- Cell annotation using the PBMC reference dataset from Hao et al. (2020)
- Merging datasets for further motif footprint and pseudotime analysis
